## Best practices:

- Set a timer for 10 minutes, see how far you get in each 10 minute chunk
- Rubber duck it: don't race through silently; go at the pace you would in assessment and talk out loud to practice using vocabulary and articulating what you are doing
- Role Play: have a classmate, rock, or mentor pretend to be your instructor while they watch your process. Listen to their feedback and focus on the things they tell you to.
